# WP AI Benchmarks

A dashboard for visualising WordPress AI benchmark results produced by [wp-bench](https://github.com/WordPress/wp-bench) — the official WordPress AI benchmark. It displays how AI models perform on WordPress-specific knowledge and code execution tasks.

## What it shows

Each model is evaluated across two categories by wp-bench:

- **Knowledge** — multiple-choice questions about WordPress APIs, hooks, block editor, caching, REST API, security, and more
- **Execution** — code generation tasks graded on correctness and quality against a live WordPress environment

Results are aggregated into four scores per model: `knowledge`, `correctness`, `quality`, and `overall`.

## Dashboard

Built with React, Vite, Recharts, and TanStack Table. Displays per-model score cards, a grouped bar chart comparison, and a filterable/sortable results table.

See [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for local development instructions.

Deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

## Data

Benchmark results are stored in [`sample.json`](sample.json) at the repo root (generated by wp-bench) and bundled into the dashboard at build time.
